# Servidor VPN para Raspberry Pi

## Configuración del lado del servidor

1. [Configurar NOOBS e instalar Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/). Para facilitar la vida, asegúrese de habilitar SSH ejecutando `raspi-config` y luego navegando a Opciones avanzadas, SSH, luego seleccione "Habilitar".

2. Actualizar Raspberry Pi.

		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get upgrade

3. Instalar el software.

		sudo apt-get install openvpn vim

4. Comience a realizar tareas como usuario root.

		sudo su

5. Copie el directorio easy-rsa de OpenVPN como archivos de plantilla (easy-rsa es para la autorización para conectarse al servidor VPN).
		
		cp –r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa 

6. Abra el archivo `vars` para editarlo. Estos son los parámetros de Easy-Rsa.

		vim /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars

7. Cambie la variable EASY_RSA a:

		export EASY_RSA="/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa"

8. Cree un certificado CA y un certificado CA raíz.

	- Cargar `vars`.

			cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
			source ./vars

   **¡Cuidado!** Ahora eliminarás todas las claves anteriores, si las hay. Si tienes claves que no quieres eliminar en esta carpeta (por ejemplo, si estás haciendo este tutorial por segunda vez), omite este comando.

			./clean-all

	- Construir la autoridad de certificación.

			./build-ca

9. Después de `./build-ca`, la Raspberry Pi te solicitará que completes una serie de campos opcionales si lo deseas: nombre del país, nombre del estado o provincia, nombre de la localidad, nombre de la organización, unidad organizativa, nombre común, nombre y dirección de correo electrónico. Si no quieres completar estos campos, simplemente presiona "enter" en cada instancia para que la Pi complete el valor predeterminado. A continuación se muestra cómo se ve:

		root@raspberrypivpn:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# ./build-ca
		Generación de una clave privada RSA de 1024 bits
		..........................++++++
		......++++++
		escribiendo nueva clave privada en 'ca.key'
		-----
		You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
		into your certificate request.
		What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
		There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
		For some fields there will be a default value,
		If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
		-----
		Country Name (2 letter code) [US]:US
		State or Province Name (full name) [CA]:WA
		Locality Name (eg, city) [SanFrancisco]:Seattle
		Organization Name (eg, company) [Fort-Funston]:Chan
		Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [changeme]:
		Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) [changeme]:chanvpn
		Name [changeme]:
		Email Address [mail@host.domain]:

10. Build the key server.

		./build-key-server [YOUR_SERVER_NAME] # example: ./build-key-server chanvpn

	Once again, there will be prompts to enter optional fields, but pay attention to 3 fields:
	
	1. Common Name MUST be the server name you picked. It should default to this.
	2. A challenge password? MUST be left blank.
	3.  `Sign the certificate? [y/n]` You must type `y`.
	
	You’ll get a message that says the certificate will be certified for 3,650 more days. So basically if you use your VPN long enough, you’ll have to do this process again in 10 years.
	
	`1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]` Type `y`.

	Output should look like: 

		Certificate is to be certified until Jun 18 22:51:59 2025 GMT (3650 days)
		Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y

		1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
		Write out database with 1 new entries
		Data Base Updated

11. We're done with the server side stuff. Now it's time to build keys for users.

		./build-key-pass [your-user-name] # example: ./build-key-pass jack

	- Enter PEM pass phrase Make it a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice, so there’s no danger of ruining it. 
	- A challenge password? MUST be left blank.
	- `Sign the certificate? [y/n]` Enter `y`. Signing certifies it for 10 more years.

12. Apply des3 encryption to the key. des3 is a complex encryption algorithm that's applied three times to each data block to keep hackers from breaking through it with brute force. OpenSSL stands for an open source implementation of Secure Socket Layer, a standard method of setting up a secure connection.

		cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
		openssl rsa -in jack.key -des3 -out jack.3des.key  

	When it asks "Enter pass phrase for jack.key", just enter the one used before.

13. Generate Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This is the central code that makes your VPN server tick, an exchange that lets two entities with no prior knowledge of one another share secret keys over a public server. Like RSA, it’s one of the earliest cryptosystems out there.

		cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
		./build-dh # this will take like 5 minutes 

14. Finally, generate a static HMAC key to be used later when creating client configuration file. This is used to prevent DOS attacks. With this in place, the server won't even entertain the idea of authenticating an access request unless it detects this static key first. Thus, a hacker can’t just spam the server with random repeated requests. 

		openvpn –-genkey –-secret keys/ta.key

15. Create a `server.conf` file for server to use as configuration.

		vim /etc/openvpn/server.conf 
		# see the server.conf provided

16. Edit another file to allow server to forward internet traffic.

		vim /etc/sysctl.conf
	
	Uncomment the line that says: `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

17. Apply changes. This command configures kernel parameters at runtime. The -p tells it to reload the file with the changes you just made. 

		sysctl -p 

18. Raspbian has a firewall to protect your Raspberry Pi from unknown and unexpected Internet sources. We still want the firewall to protect us from most incoming and outgoing network traffic, but we need to poke an OpenVPN-shaped hole in the firewall. Raspbian’s firewall configuration resets by default when you reboot the Pi. We want to make sure it remembers the OpenVPN connection is always permitted, so what we’re going to do is create a simple script which runs on boot:

		vim /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh

	With these contents (remember to change 192.168.XX.X to whatever Raspberry Pi's address is):

		#!/bin/sh 

		iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.XX.X

	Explanation: 10.8.0.0 is the default address for Raspberry Pi for clients that are connected to the VPN. "eth0" stands for ethernet port. Switch this to "wlan0" if you’re on a wireless connection, which is not recommended. 

19. Make the script run in the `interfaces` setup on boot.

		vim /etc/network/interfaces

	Add the following after `iface eth0 inet dhcp` (note there is a tab before `pre-up`): 

			pre-up /etc/firewall-openvpn-rules.sh

	See `interfaces` file for the change

20. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

		sudo reboot

	Note that upon startup, there will be errors like:

		[warn] Kernel lacks cgroups or memory controller not available, not starting cgroups. ... (warning).
		[FAIL] Not running dhcpcd because /etc/network/interfaces ... failed!
		[FAIL] defines some interfaces that will use a DHCP client ... failed!
		.
		.
		.
		[warn] startpar: service(s) skipped, program is not configured: dhcpcd ... (warning).

	Despite these failures and warnings, the VPN server will run just fine.

## Client Side Setup

With the previous steps finished, you've got a functional VPN server ready on your Raspberry Pi. Keys have been created too, but clients still have no way to connect to the server. They will each need a configuration file with their key in order to connect. Also, at this point, you'll need to use a dynamic DNS service so that you can access your Raspberry Pi from outside the local network.

1. Your public IP address can change, unless your ISP gives a static IP address. So, you'll need a dynamic DNS provider to provide a stable name that maps to your changing IP address (there will be code/cron job on the server that updates the dynamic DNS provider when the IP changes). A good, free dynamic DNS provider is Duck DNS at [www.duckdns.org](www.duckdns.org). Sign up on the website (asks you to use Facebook, Google, Twitter, or Reddit). You can then choose a subdomain (http://[YOUR_SUBDOMAIN].duckdns.org). Finally, click on the install tab, click on "pi" for the operating system option, and follow the instructions. The instructions creates a cron job that updates Duck DNS so that it knows what your public IP address is. It periodically checks the IP address and updates Duck DNS.

2. Enter the router config (go to 192.168.1.1 or whatever your router is) and forward a port. You'll need to create the port forwarding rule, specifying your Raspberry Pi as the IP address to forward and then for the application to forward, select "Custom Port". Select "UDP" as the protocol, source ports as "Any", destination ports as "1194", forward to port as "Same as Incoming Port", schedule as "always", and WAN connection type as "All Broadband Devices". This makes it so that any traffic that hits the 1194 port (OpenVPN's official port number) will be sent to the Raspberry Pi (the VPN server).

3. Back on the Raspberry Pi, create default settings to generate configuration files for each client.

		vim /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/Default.txt

	With the following:

		client
		dev tun
		proto udp
		remote YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.duckdns.org 1194
		resolv-retry infinite
		nobind
		persist-key
		persist-tun
		mute-replay-warnings
		ns-cert-type server
		key-direction 1
		cipher AES-128-CBC
		comp-lzo
		verb 1
		mute 20

4. Create script to generate the config file that clients will use, and then execute script.

		vim /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/makeOVPN.sh
		# see makeOVPN.sh provided
		chmod 700 makeOVPN.sh
		./makeOVPN.sh

	You'll then be asked to enter an existing client name. Enter the client name you put in previously. After you've done that, you should see something like:

		root@raspberrypivpn:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys# ./makeOVPN.sh
		Please enter an existing Client Name:
		jack
		Client’s cert found: jack
		Client’s Private Key found: jack.3des.key
		CA public Key found: ca.crt
		tls-auth Private Key found: ta.key
		Done! jack.ovpn Successfully Created.

5. Now, you'll need to copy the configuration files (the ones with `.ovpn` extension) from `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/` over to the clients. For OSX, use a program like Fugu to SCP files over or access the files via SFTP. On Windows, use something like WinSCP. In order to access the files, you'll need to enable access of the folder:

		chmod 777 -R /etc/openvpn

	Be sure to put back restriction after you're done so that other people can't get keys.

		chmod 600 -R /etc/openvpn

6. Now you can use client software to connect to the VPN server! For your PC, Android, or iOS mobile device, download [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/). On OSX, TunnelBlick is a good, free option. To use TunnelBlick, install it, and then double-click a `.ovpn` file (should default to open TunnelBlick). If everything's been done correctly, you'll be asked to enter a keyphrase (enter in the one that you used to create the client key), and you'll be connected!

## Bonus - Give Raspberry Pi a Static IP Address

The Raspberry Pi's IP address has not been configured to be static. It's an inconvenience if you unplug the Raspberry Pi or the router is restarted, the Raspberry Pi's IP address might change. Making the address static will alleviate this, and in order to do it, configuration must be performed on both the Raspberry Pi and the router. 

1. Configure router to use set range for DHCP so that there are a few addresses left for static assignment. For example, in IP Address Distribution under the Advanced section (configuration will vary depending on router), set the Dynamic IP Range to be 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.250, provided the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. This allows 192.168.1.251 to 192.168.1.254 to be static addresses. Now choose one of those static addresses to be the Raspberry Pi's. As an example, we'll use 192.168.1.251.

2. Gather configuration information.

		ifconfig
	
	Look for `eth0`, and write down:
	- **Bcast** - broadcast IP range, something like 192.168.1.255
	- **Mask** - subnet mask address, something like 255.255.255.0

	Example:

		pi@raspberrypivpn ~ $ ifconfig
		eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:27:eb:be:77:a2
		          inet addr:192.168.1.251  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
		          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
		          RX packets:41352 errors:0 dropped:94 overruns:0 frame:0
		          TX packets:11824 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
		          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
		          RX bytes:7856036 (7.4 MiB)  TX bytes:2930081 (2.7 MiB)

	Now we need IP routing info 

		netstat -nr

	Look for `eth0`, and write down
	- **Gateway** address - something like 192.168.1.1
	- **Destination** address - something like 192.168.1.0

	Example:

		pi@raspberrypivpn ~ $ netstat -nr
		Kernel IP routing table
		Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
		0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
		0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
		10.8.0.0        10.8.0.2        255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0
		10.8.0.2        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH        0 0          0 tun0
		192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0

3. Set the configuration on the Raspberry Pi.

		sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

	Simply change the line that reads `iface eth0 inet dhcp` to `iface eth0 inet static`, and paste these lines below it (note you need to replace the addresses with the ones you gathered in the last step, and the address is the static IP address you set in step 1):

		address 192.168.1.251
		netmask 255.255.255.0
		network 192.168.1.0
		broadcast 192.168.1.255
		gateway 192.168.1.1

4. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

		sudo reboot

	The Raspberry Pi should show up with from now on with the new static IP address.

## Post Setup Quick Reference

### Create More Users

1. Create key.

		sudo su
		cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
		source ./vars
		./build-key-pass [CLIENT_NAME] # example: ./build-key-pass iphone

	There will be prompts to enter optional fields, but pay attention to 3 fields:
	
	- Enter PEM pass phrase Make it a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice, so there’s no danger of ruining it. 
	- A challenge password? MUST be left blank.
	- `Sign the certificate? [y/n]` Enter "y". Signing certifies it for 10 more years.

2. Add des3 encrpytion to key.

		cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
		openssl rsa -in [CLIENT_NAME].key -des3 -out [CLIENT_NAME].3des.key # example: openssl rsa -in iphone.key -des3 -out iphone.3des.key

	When it asks "Enter pass phrase for [CLIENT_NAME].key", just enter the one used before.

3. Create configuration (the `.ovpn` file that client needs)

		cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
		./makeOVPN.sh

	You'll then be asked to enter an existing client name. Enter the CLIENT_NAME you put in the previous two steps. After you've done that, you should see something like:

		root@raspberrypivpn:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys# ./makeOVPN.sh
		Please enter an existing Client Name:
		iphone
		Client’s cert found: iphone
		Client’s Private Key found: iphone.3des.key
		CA public Key found: ca.crt
		tls-auth Private Key found: ta.key
		Done! iphone.ovpn Successfully Created.
